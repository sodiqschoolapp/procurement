# Decisions

Two kinds of entries live here.

- **Standing decisions**: what the owner decided outside the spec. They hold for every task. A new one is added by the owner's word only, with the date.
- **Task sections**: every task appends its own dated section in `/finish-task`, listing each technical choice made alone and why. Business rules never appear there; those go through `/spec-change`.

## Standing decisions

| # | Date | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | 10.10.2026 | The spec is final at document revision 123. `docs/spec/` in this repository is now the source of truth; the earlier online document is history. Changes go through `/spec-change` only. | Owner: "final". |
| D2 | 10.10.2026 | Assumptions A1 to A14 are confirmed. A7, A8 and A11 were confirmed with changes, already written into `02-assumptions.md`. | Owner's answers. |
| D3 | 10.10.2026 | What matters most, in order: money and stock always correct; nobody sees or changes another branch's data; the approval order cannot be skipped. | Owner agreed to the ranking. |
| D4 | 10.10.2026 | The audit log and the notification bell are built in phase 0 as foundations. The spec's build order lists them under phases 1 and 2; the product order is otherwise unchanged. | Owner: "do whichever is logical". Every later task writes audit rows and notifications, so the helpers must exist first. |
| D5 | 10.10.2026 | There is no REST API. "API foundations" means the server-action wrapper of task 0.8. | The spec's stack uses Server Actions. |
| D6 | 10.10.2026 | Technical choices are recorded in this file, `docs/decisions.md`. | Owner: change the spec's wording; done in architecture rule 15. |
| D7 | 10.10.2026 | Package manager: npm. | It ships with Node.js, so nothing extra is installed. |
| D8 | 10.10.2026 | The second reviewer is `permission-reviewer`. Money and stock rules are the first thing the `spec-reviewer` checks. | Owner: "whichever". Permissions touch every action of every task and are the hardest to see in a hand test. |
| D9 | 10.10.2026 | The Head creates each password and can renew any user's password at any time, typed or generated; a renewal signs that user out on every device at once; users cannot change their own. There are no password rules and no forced change at first sign-in. A session lasts 24 hours after sign-in, on any device. | Owner's answers; written into A8. |
| D10 | 10.10.2026 | The first day of the school year is a setting (`school_year_start`). | Owner's answer. |
| D11 | 10.10.2026 | No Telegram and no other messenger, email or SMS. Notifications are the in-app bell only. | Owner's answer. |
| D12 | 10.10.2026 | Claude Code writes the interface texts in Uzbek, Russian and English; the owner corrects Uzbek and Russian (task 8.4). | Owner: "you write". |
| D13 | 10.10.2026 | No `LICENSE` file for now. | Owner: "maybe". Open question 4. |
| D14 | 10.10.2026 | Addresses: `ombor.sodiqschool.uz` for production and `ombor-test.sodiqschool.uz` for the test copy. | Owner chose `ombor.sodiqschool.uz`; the test address follows it. |
| D15 | 10.10.2026 | Hosting as the spec says: app and database on DigitalOcean in Frankfurt, files on Cloudflare R2, test copy included, about $42 a month. | Owner chose it on 10.10.2026. |
| D16 | 10.10.2026 | The owner's machine is Windows 11. Tools are checked and installed in step "Once" of `docs/START-HERE.md`. The GitHub repository is private and is `sodiqschoolapp/procurement`. | Owner's answers. |
| D17 | 10.10.2026 | Only the owner merges pull requests. No skill, agent or session merges or pushes to `main`. | The working method of the starter pack. |
| D18 | 11.10.2026 | The local storage service moves from task 0.2 to task 0.12. Task 0.2 puts PostgreSQL only into `docker-compose.yml`. Before task 0.12, `/spec-change` names what replaces MinIO on the developer's computer. | MinIO's public images were removed from Docker Hub in September 2026 and the project `minio/minio` is archived (25.04.2026, "no longer maintained"). Nothing before 0.12 uses file storage. Owner: "yes" on 11.10.2026 (review of the plan of 0.2, answer 2). |

## Task sections

Each task adds one section here, newest at the bottom:

```
### <id> <title> (<date>)
- <choice made alone>: <reason>.
- Constraint style, naming or structure introduced: <what later tasks must follow>.
```

### 0.1 Repository skeleton (10.10.2026)

- TypeScript 6.0.x, not 7.0: `typescript-eslint` 8.71, which `eslint-config-next` 16.4 brings, accepts TypeScript below 6.1 only. It moves up when `typescript-eslint` declares support for 7 and lint, typecheck and build pass with it.
- ESLint 9.x, not 10: `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-import` and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, all brought by `eslint-config-next` 16.4, accept ESLint up to 9. npm marks ESLint 9 as no longer supported. It moves up when an `eslint-config-next` release has all its plugins accepting 10; nothing is forced with `--legacy-peer-deps` or `overrides`.
- Node.js 24: `.nvmrc` says `24` and `engines` says `>=24`. Vitest 5 needs 22.12, 24 or newer; the owner's machine has 24.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is on beside `strict`: an array or record read may be `undefined`, which is where wrong totals start. If a shadcn-generated file fails under it, that one file gets the smallest fix; the flag stays (plan review).
- `tsconfig.json` has `"types": ["node"]` because TypeScript 6 no longer loads every `@types` package by itself, `"allowJs": true` because Next.js writes it on the first run and a clean clone must not be rewritten, and `**/*.mts` in `include` so `vitest.config.mts` is type-checked.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint with no warnings allowed and then `prettier --check .`: one script guards both, so CI needs no extra step. `npm run format` fixes formatting (approved in the plan review).
- `.prettierignore` holds `docs/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `drizzle/`, `package-lock.json` and the build folders: the spec, the working method, the project rules and merged migrations are never rewritten by a tool.
- Prettier: line width 100, and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` keeps Tailwind class names in one order (approved in the plan review).
- `npm run typecheck` runs `next typegen` before `tsc --noEmit`: `next-env.d.ts` is ignored by git, so a clean clone has to generate it first.
- `vitest.config.mts`, not `.ts`: the `.ts` name made Vite warn about ESM syntax in a file loaded as CommonJS.
- shadcn/ui: style `base-vega`, which is the Base UI library with the Vega look (the classic shadcn look, Inter as its font), base colour `neutral`, CSS variables, lucide icons. Decided in the review of the finished work on the owner's behalf: since July 2026 shadcn recommends Base UI for new projects and a new component may exist for Base UI only; Vega and not Nova, because Nova has "reduced padding and margins for compact layouts", against rules 13 and 15 of `11-screens-and-ux.md` (44 px touch targets, plenty of white space). The plan said `new-york` (built on Radix). No component exists yet and `@base-ui/react` is not installed: it comes with the first component, and the plan of that task lists it.
- How `base-vega` was applied: the tool was run for that style in a throwaway copy outside the repository; its `components.json` and its theme in `globals.css` were compared with ours. Apart from what the plan removes or places elsewhere (the two `--font-*` theme lines and the Inter import, the `.dark` block, `src/lib/utils.ts`, the `lib` and `hooks` aliases), only the style and the two menu keys of `components.json` differed, so that file alone changed. Task 0.10, which brings Inter, has to add the two `--font-*` theme lines.
- `npm run dev` is `next dev --hostname 127.0.0.1`: the development server answers this machine only (review of the finished work; `CLAUDE.md`, "What matters most", point 2). By default Next.js answers every device on the network, and from task 0.6 that server holds a sign-in and a database. `http://localhost:3000` still opens. Screens are checked on a phone by Playwright at 375 px and, from task 0.15, on the test copy.
- The Geist font, the `.dark` block and the button that the shadcn set-up wrote are removed: Inter and the look are task 0.10, the app has a light theme only (`11-screens-and-ux.md` rule 15), and the plan adds no component. The line `@custom-variant dark` stays, so the `dark:` classes inside shadcn components never apply, whatever the device prefers.
- `shadcn` and `tw-animate-css` are development dependencies. The app uses each for one CSS import at build time, the shadcn registry itself declares them so, and `tailwindcss` already sits there. With `shadcn` in `dependencies`, as its set-up wrote it, the production tree had 378 packages and 7 high audit findings; now it has none.
- `cn()` lives at `src/components/utils.ts` and comes from the package `cn`, which shadcn now installs in place of `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`. The `CLAUDE.md` layout has no `src/lib/`; the shadcn aliases for `lib` and `hooks` point inside `src/components/` too.
- `agentRules: false` in `next.config.ts`: Next.js 16.4 writes an `AGENTS.md` into the repository when `next dev` sees an AI coding agent, which left the tree dirty after every Playwright run. `CLAUDE.md` is the rules file here; a second one is the owner's decision.
- Feature areas (`src/features/<area>/`) get their `actions/`, `queries/` and `components/` folders with their first file. Empty folders are kept in git by a `.gitkeep`, removed when the first real file arrives.
- The start-page texts are read by a plain import of `uz.json` until task 0.5 brings next-intl; the three message files exist from the first commit, so rule 13 never had an exception.
- `.env.example` holds no name until a task's code reads one; names are not invented ahead of the code. A test refuses any line with a value, and any comment that holds an `=`.
- `db:migrate` and `db:seed` are placeholders that print `NOT BUILT YET: <script> arrives in task <id>` and end without an error (plan review, answer 3), until tasks 0.2 and 0.14 replace them.
- Playwright runs Chromium only, in two projects: `phone-375` and `desktop-1440`, the two widths of the quality bar. It starts `npm run dev` itself.
- Version ranges with a committed `package-lock.json`; `npm ci` for a clean install.
- Naming or structure introduced: where no spec rule exists, a test names the build-plan task or the `CLAUDE.md` line it guards and says so in a comment (plan review). Playwright tests read expected texts from the message files and never type them again.

### 0.2 Database and migrations (11.10.2026)

**The constraint style.** Written once here; every later migration follows it (`developer-rules.md` rules 5, 6, 10, 11, 12; `14-data-model.md`).

1. **Names.** Tables and columns are written in snake_case exactly as `14-data-model.md` writes them. The Drizzle schema states every column name itself.
2. **Keys.** `id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` (built into PostgreSQL, no extension). Where the data model shows a different key, that key is the primary key and the table has no `id`.
3. **`created_at`.** `timestamptz NOT NULL`, **with no database default**, on every table, also on the eight with their own key (`settings`, `user_branches`, `manager_rights`, `stock_minimums`, `number_counters`, `purchase_files`, `orf_settlements`, `stock_balances`): in "unless a different key is shown" the exception is about the key only (plan review, answer 5). The value comes from the injected clock (rule 10), so a test that sets the clock also sets `created_at`, and a write that forgets it fails loudly instead of quietly taking the database's time (plan review, answer 6).
4. **Time.** A moment is always `timestamptz`; `timestamp` without a time zone is never used. The session time zone is UTC. A business date (`needed_by`, `purchased_on`, `occurred_on`, `doc_date`) is a `date` column, read as the text `YYYY-MM-DD` and never as a JavaScript `Date`, which would shift it by the machine's time zone.
5. **Enums.** Every list that `14-data-model.md` writes in square brackets is a PostgreSQL enum (`CREATE TYPE`): statuses, progress, kinds, types, roles, payment types, priority, locale, the nine Manager rights, counter scopes, price sources, and any other bracketed list. The enum is named for what it means in singular snake_case (`orf_status`, `payment_type`), with the values exactly as the data model writes them. Never a text column with a list. A new value is a new migration (`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`); a value is never renamed or removed.
6. **Money.** `bigint`, whole so'm, read in TypeScript as `bigint` (Drizzle `mode: "bigint"`). `mode: "number"` is forbidden on a money column. Every amount has a CHECK; its task takes the bound from the spec.
7. **Quantities.** `numeric(14,3)`, read as text and handed to decimal.js inside `src/domain/`. `mode: "number"` is forbidden here too.
8. **NOT NULL** unless the spec says the value can be absent; the task's plan names each column that may be empty and why.
9. **Relations.** Every relation has a foreign key. Nothing cascades: `ON DELETE` is left at "no action", because nothing with data is deleted (rule 11). The draft that was never submitted is the one exception and its task designs it. Every foreign key and every filter column gets its index in the same migration (rule 12).
10. **Constraint names** are written out: `<table>_<what>_check`, `<table>_<columns>_key` for unique, `<table>_<columns>_idx` for an index. A primary key keeps PostgreSQL's own name, `<table>_pkey`. A test, and later an error message, can then name the constraint that refused a write.
11. **Text** is `text`; JSON is `jsonb`.
12. **Each constraint has a database test that tries the forbidden write directly** (rule 5, "Proved by"). `refusalOf()` in `tests/helpers/database-error.ts` returns the code, constraint, table and column PostgreSQL names.
13. **Migrations.** One file per task unless the plan says why; written by `npx drizzle-kit generate --name <name>`, read, then committed; SQL that Drizzle cannot express is added by hand to the same file and said so in a comment. A merged migration is never edited. No `DROP` without the owner's yes. `drizzle-kit push` is never used.

The tables the login library creates itself in task 0.6 are the one place this style may not hold; the plan of 0.6 lists where they differ.

**Choices made alone, and decided in the reviews.**

- Driver `pg`, not postgres.js (plan review, answer 3): a plain pool with a transaction on one connection, which the action wrapper of 0.8 needs for row locks; Drizzle and Better Auth both accept it.
- The local database has no password: `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust` in `docker-compose.yml` (plan review, answer 4). Safe there and nowhere else: the port answers on `127.0.0.1` only and the data is invented. `.env.example` holds the one name `DATABASE_URL`; `README.md` shows the local address in full because it holds no secret. `pg`, Drizzle's migrator and the PostgreSQL image all work with it; the fallback to a password was not needed.
- PostgreSQL is published on `127.0.0.1:5433`, not 5432: on the owner's machine another PostgreSQL holds 5432 on every network interface (plan review, correction 1).
- `cluster_name=procurement-compose` is set on the server of `docker-compose.yml`, and a database test reads it back. With a second PostgreSQL on the same machine, the version alone cannot show which server answered (plan review, correction 1). The database tests therefore pass only against the service of `docker-compose.yml`.
- Image `postgres:17` (the Debian image), a named volume, a health check with `pg_isready`.
- The pool holds at most 10 connections; every connection sets `timezone=UTC` through the connection option `options`, so no query can run before it. In development the pool is kept on `globalThis` across hot reloads.
- `bigint` and `numeric` arrive from `pg` as text, its own default, and no global type parser is changed: a raw query gives exact digits, and a column gives `bigint` through Drizzle's `mode: "bigint"`.
- `.env` is read by Node.js's own `--env-file-if-exists` and `process.loadEnvFile()`; no `dotenv`. The scripts are plain `.mjs`; no `tsx`.
- `db:migrate`: Drizzle's migrator applies the files but returns nothing, so `scripts/apply-migrations.mjs` works out the names beside it, from `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` and Drizzle's bookkeeping table `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`, with the comparison the migrator makes itself. After migrating it counts the bookkeeping rows again and stops with an error if the count does not match its report. Chosen by the owner in the session on 11.10.2026 (way a of the pull-request comment) over printing a count or no detail.
- No npm script for writing a migration: the Build line names only `db:migrate`. The command is in `README.md`.
- Two Vitest projects: `unit` (nothing running) and `db` (files named `*.db.test.ts`, PostgreSQL running). `npm test` runs both.
- A database per test file, named `procurement_test_<12 hex digits>`, copied from `procurement_test_template`, which each run builds once from the migrations and drops at the end. Chosen over one shared database that is emptied: files run side by side, tests can really commit (the same-moment tests of 0.4 need it), and nothing is left behind because the whole database is dropped. The global setup first drops test databases a crashed run left.
- The helper creates and drops only names that match `procurement_test_[a-z0-9_]{1,40}`, checked before a command is sent. It connects to the server's own `postgres` database to do so, and never to the database of `DATABASE_URL`.
- Database tests of a schema file or the client sit beside the code (`src/server/db/**/*.db.test.ts`); tests of the migrations and the helper sit in `tests/`.
- `npm audit`: the production tree has no finding. `drizzle-kit` 0.31.11, a development tool, brings 4 moderate findings through the `esbuild` 0.18 inside `@esbuild-kit`, about esbuild's own development server, which nothing here starts. Not forced with `overrides`; it goes when drizzle-kit drops that package.
